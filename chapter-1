1. What is a typical resting potential difference across the membrane of a cortical neuron? Explain the biochemical mechanisms
   that allow the neuron to maintain this potential difference? 

Ans: -65 to -70 mV. The sodium potassium pumps on the membrane of a neuron maintain this potential difference by expending energy.


2. Describe the sequence of events that gives rise to an action potential. Start from a volley of action potentials arriving along 
   the input axons to the neuron and trace the biochemical and electrical consequences leading to an output action potential.

Ans: The neuron receives an electrical signal through its dendrites first maybe due to the action potential from a presynaptic
     neuron or due to some environmentary action, which opens the sodium ion channels in the neuron's membrane and causes rapid 
     influx of Na+ ions into the neuron. This causes the neuron's membrane potential to go rise rapidly till it goes positive
     , this causes the potassium ion channels to open up leading to a rapid outflux of Ka+ ions from the cell thus causing 
     the membrane potential to go down again back to -70 mV. This spike from -70 to 0 to -70 again is called the action potential.
     This spike travels through the axon to the axonal end where it leads to the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters 
     in the synapse. These neurotransmitters are receieved by the dendrites of the post synaptic neuron thus leading to an action
     potential in the postsynaptic neuron now.


3. What are the four prominent types of synaptic plasticity observed in the brain? Explain how they serve to modify the effect of 
   a presynaptic spike on the postsynaptic neuron.

Ans:
