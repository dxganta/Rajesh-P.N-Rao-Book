1. What is a typical resting potential difference across the membrane of a cortical neuron? Explain the biochemical mechanisms
   that allow the neuron to maintain this potential difference?
   Ans: -65 to -70 mV. The sodium potassium pumps on the membrane of a neuron maintain this potential difference by expending energy.

2. Describe the sequence of events that gives rise to an action potential. Start from a volley of action potentials arriving along
   the input axons to the neuron and trace the biochemical and electrical consequences leading to an output action potential.
   Ans: The neuron receives an electrical signal through its dendrites first maybe due to the action potential from a presynaptic
   neuron or due to some environmentary action, which opens the sodium ion channels in the neuron's membrane and causes rapid
   influx of Na+ ions into the neuron. This causes the neuron's membrane potential to go rise rapidly till it goes positive
   , this causes the potassium ion channels to open up leading to a rapid outflux of Ka+ ions from the cell thus causing
   the membrane potential to go down again back to -70 mV. This spike from -70 to 0 to -70 again is called the action potential.
   This spike travels through the axon to the axonal end where it leads to the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters
   in the synapse. These neurotransmitters are receieved by the dendrites of the post synaptic neuron thus leading to an action
   potential in the postsynaptic neuron now.

3. What are the four prominent types of synaptic plasticity observed in the brain? Explain how they serve to modify the effect of
   a presynaptic spike on the postsynaptic neuron.
   Ans: 1. Long Term Potentiation (LTP) : It strengthens the effect of the presynaptic spike on the postsynaptic neuron, caused by correlated
   firing of the two neurons. 2. Long Term Depression (LTD) : It weakens the effect, caused by uncorrelated firing of the two neurons for a long time. 3. Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) : It matters on the timing between the presynaptic spike and the postsynaptic spike.
   If the presynaptic spike occurs slightly before the postsynaptic spike (e.g 1-40 ms before), the synapse is strenghtened and vice versa. 4. Short Term Facilitaion and Depression (STF/STD) : In STD the strength of the spikes gradually decrease with each successive
   spike between the neurons until an equilibrium is reached after which all successive spikes have the same diminished effect.
   In STF the opposite happens and each successive spike is strenghtened untill an equilibrium is reached.

4. What are the major components of the CNS and the PNS ?
   Ans: CNS: Brain and Spinal Cord
   PNS: Somatic Nervous System and Autonomic Nervous System

5. Describe the functions that have been ascribed to the brain stem and the cerebellum.
   Ans: The brain stem conveys all information from the brain to various parts of the body. Cerebellum is responsible for
   coordination of movements.

6. What are the major components and functions of the diencephalon?
   Ans: Thalamus: It acts as a "relay station" that conveys information from the sensory organs to the neocortex.
   Hypothalamus: It is involved in basic human needs like fighting, feeding, fleeing and mating.

7. What are some of the functions thought to be carried out by the basal ganglia and the hippocampus?
   Ans: The basal ganglia plays an important role in motor control and action selection. The hippocampus is important for memory and learning, besides spatial cognition.

8. Approximately how many cells does the neocortex contain? How many synapses on average does a corital neuron have with other neurons?
   Ans: 30 billion. 10,000 synapses.

9. What are the major areas of the neocortex and what are some of their functions?
   Ans: Occipital Lobe - near the back of the head speicialize in basic visual processing.
   Parietal Lobe - near the front of the head speicialize in motion processing and spatial reasoning.
   Visual and auditory recognition occurs in the temporal areas while frontal areas are involved in planning and higher
   cognitive functions.

10. Is the cortex hierarchically organized? Discuss evidence for and against this hypothesis?
    Ans:Certainly! The hierarchical organization of the cortex is a complex and multifaceted concept, and there is still much that we do not know. However, the following provides a more detailed overview of the evidence for the hierarchy and some of the current debates.

Evidence for the hierarchy:

Neuroanatomy: One of the main lines of evidence for the hierarchical organization of the cortex comes from studies of the brain's anatomy. Researchers have found that the cortex is divided into a number of distinct regions, each of which is specialized for a specific function. These regions are connected by pathways that form the so-called "processing hierarchy." For example, the primary visual cortex is connected to the secondary visual cortex, which is connected to the tertiary visual cortex, and so on.

Neurophysiology: Another line of evidence comes from studies of the brain's physiology. Researchers have found that neurons in different regions of the cortex show different patterns of activity depending on the type of information they are processing. For example, neurons in the primary visual cortex respond strongly to simple stimuli, like flashes of light or moving bars, while neurons in higher-level regions respond to more complex stimuli, like faces or scenes. This suggests that the cortex is organized into a series of processing stages, with each stage building on the outputs of the previous stage.

Cognitive psychology: Cognitive psychology has also provided evidence for the hierarchical organization of the cortex. Researchers have found that the processing of information in the cortex occurs in a series of stages, with each stage building on the outputs of the previous stage. For example, in the processing of visual information, the first stage might extract basic features like edges or lines, while subsequent stages might combine these features into objects or scenes.

Debates about the hierarchy:

Rigidity vs. flexibility: One of the ongoing debates about the hierarchy of the cortex is whether it is highly rigid, with each stage having a well-defined set of inputs and outputs, or whether it is more flexible and that information can be processed in parallel at multiple levels. Some researchers argue that the hierarchy is highly rigid, while others argue that it is more flexible and that information can be processed in parallel at multiple levels.

Multiple processing streams: Another ongoing debate is whether the cortex is organized into a single, strictly hierarchical processing stream, or whether it contains a number of parallel processing streams, each of which is specialized for a specific function. Some researchers argue that the cortex is organized into a single, strict hierarchy, while others argue that it contains a number of parallel processing streams.

Role of subcortical regions: Finally, there is ongoing debate about the role of subcortical regions, such as the thalamus, in the processing hierarchy. Some researchers argue that the cortex and subcortical regions form a single, integrated processing hierarchy, while others argue that the subcortical regions play a more limited role, serving as a gateway between the cortex and the rest of the brain.

It is important to note that while the hierarchical organization of the cortex is widely accepted, it is still an active area of research and there is much that we do not know. Further studies are needed to fully understand the precise nature of the hierarchy and how it is implemented in the brain.
